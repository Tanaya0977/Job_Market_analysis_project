Project: Job Market Analysis
About Dataset-
•	In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the job market trends for various positions, with a specific focus on data science roles.
•	The dataset comprised 742 rows and 42 features, encompassing essential information such as Job Title, Salary Estimate, Job Description,Rating, Company, Location, and more. 
•	The dataset was meticulously gathered from diverse sources.
Project Objectives-
•	My primary goal was to extract valuable insights that could provide job seekers and employers with valuable information about the industry landscape. 
•	By leveraging on MySQL Workbench, I aimed to address pertinent questions and provide meaningful insights.
Key Achievements-
•	Identified the states with the highest job opportunities.
•	Calculated the average minimum and maximum salaries across different states.
•	Determined the average salary trends across various states.
•	Recognized the top five industries contributing to the maximum number of data science job postings.
•	Discovered companies with the most job openings.
•	Highlighted job titles with the highest frequency in job listings.
•	Investigated the salary ranges for job titles with the most opportunities.
•	Identified the key skills demanded by employers for each job title.

•	Microsoft Power BI to visualize and interpret the data, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the dataset.
Notable Findings-
•	Based on my observations, the data pointed towards a high demand for data scientists, accounting for a significant share of job openings (155) across the United States. Key skills in demand included Python, Excel, and SQL. For entry-level positions, the estimated salary ranged from $56,000 to $95,000, while senior data scientists commanded a salary range of $180,000 to $171,000.
Suggestion to the company-Job titles insights-Recommend creating specialized roles within the Data Scientist category, such as Junior Data Scientist, to cater to varying experience levels.
•	Salary range consideration-Suggest periodic salary reviews to ensure compensation aligns with market standards and employee experience.
•	Long term planning-Advise the company to create a long-term plan for addressing the growing demand for Data Scientists and hiring candidates with strong proficiency in these skills to meet the demand efficiently.
